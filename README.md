# PRICE-PREDICTION-OF-THE-USED-CARS-A-MULTIPLE-REGRESSION-APPROACH-USING-PYTHON
The project aims to predict the prices of used cars manufactured by Hyundai, Maruti, Mahindra and Tata based on various features.
The original dataset had 8128 observations and 13 attributes (or variables). After various steps on data cleaning and processing, the dataset is reduced to 4280 observations.
The final dataset of 4280 observations was split into training dataset and test dataset with 70:30 ratio. The dependent variable was the price of the used cars and six predictor variables were used for data modelling. Out of these six variables, one variable is a categorical variable.
Such six variables are selected after trying several combinations of 13 variables. All six variables are statistically significant and are able to explain around 75% of the variations in the dependent variable.
The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) works out to 39%, which indicates ‘reasonable accuracy’ of the forecasting model.
